This project was intended to give me a quick way to practice applying the paradigms I learned in my data structures and algorithms class (CS 61B) to a fun problem in Python. Despite the speed limitations of the Wikipedia API (see Experimentations.ipynb), I decided to continue with this project for this reason.
